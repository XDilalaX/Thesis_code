This repository explains all the steps and code that needs to be used to replicate the results of the conducted research
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware information: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this research, the open-source programming language R \cite{2009TeamRC} and the development environment Rstudio \cite{2012LukeT,2012Jeffrey} are used. The whole research has not yet been conducted therefore it could be that other programming languages were used as well. The specific Packages used for this research can be found in the appendix of the final Thesis paper. The used hardware in this work is Intel Core i7-8550U, 2.40 GHz, and 5.00 GHz dual-core x64-based processor with 8.00 GB RAM. 

Preparation of hardware: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download R version 4.3.0, from https://cran.rstudio.com/
2. Dowload the IDE compatible with R version 4.3.0 called Rstudio, from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
3. Download Rtools43, from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html
4. Download code from Github, from \url{https://github.com/XDilalaX/Thesis_code/tree/main}
5. Run the code!

Program information: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The whole program used for this research consists of 13 R program files, each fulfilling their own task, as explained below: 

1.  Thesis_code_pca.R: This program shows step 2 up until 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with PCA as its dimension reduction technique. 
2. Thesis_code_ica.R: This program shows step 2 up until 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with ICA as its dimension reduction technique.
3. Thesis_code_isomap.R: This program shows step 2 up until 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with Isomap as its dimension reduction technique.
4. Thesis_code_tsne.R: This program shows step 2 up until 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with t-SNE as its dimension reduction technique. 
5. Thesis_code_lle.R: This program shows step 2 up until 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with LLE as its dimension reduction technique. 
6. Thesis_code_isomap.R: This program shows step 2 up until 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with Isomap as its dimension reduction technique.
7. Thesis_code_pca_extension.R: This program shows the code for the extension part of the thesis. This code consists of step 0 up to 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with PCA as its dimension reduction technique. 
8. Thesis_code_ica_extension.R: This program shows the code for the extension part of the thesis. This code consists of step 0 up to 4 for the research of the thesis for k-means and AGNES clustering with ICA as its dimension reduction technique.
